## Ideas for Analysis
* Cross it with weather and demographic (census) data or other sources and see what crimes are affected by weather, season, regional income, neighborhood, population density, unemployment, taxes, home values, etc.
* See what crimes are increasing or decreasing, at what rate and over what timeframes.  Try to figure out why.
* Pick and discover good metrics… total crimes may go up less than the population, so crimes per person (often crimes per 100,000 people) is a common metric, as is crimes per square mile if you're reporting by county/city/region.  Come up with others.
* Confirm known or reported statistics.  One of the best way to validate your metrics is to compare to something known.  If you can find a news article that says crime is going up or down in an area, validate their assumptions and yours and recreate the finding.
* Try and pick something that stands out significantly… imagine you were a lawmaker or police chief -- what changes can you justify based on the data?  Can you, for example, find an event (tax change, construction, street fair) that typically causes a crime spike where you would task additional resources?  Can you prove that this has happened in the past enough to justify a policy change?
